This is a project I started as a spike to try the CQRS + ES

It's a full custom membershipprovider that you can use in your .NET projects

I used autofac for the IoC part, while NHibernate for the ReadModel.
For the sample MVC3 project I used Twitter bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)


For the event store I used the work of Jonathan Oliver (https://github.com/joliver/EventStore and https://github.com/joliver/CommonDomain)
And I also based my work on the work of Greg Young (https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) and Henrik Feldt (https://github.com/haf/Documently) 

Any suggestions are more than welcome
