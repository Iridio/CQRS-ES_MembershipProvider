This project first started as a spike to try the CQRS + ES

I started this after having the luck to attend a 5 days course with Greg Young

This is a full custom membershipprovider.

I used the CommonDomain and EventStore from Jonathan Oliver (https://github.com/joliver/EventStore and https://github.com/joliver/CommonDomain)
And is also based on the work of Greg Young (https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) and Henrik Feldt (https://github.com/haf/Documently) 

Any suggestions are more than welcome
